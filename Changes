          - add test requirement on the minimal Config::MVP needed to handle
            an edge case that we test our handling of
          - new EXPERIMENTAL -default config option, instructing CPAN clients
            to install the features when running non-interactively

0.005     2013-09-02 23:53:12Z
          - no longer setting dynamic_config => 1 -- it is generally the CPAN
            client that interrogates the user, not Makefile.PL/Build.PL
          - detect invalid syntax in feature name (e.g. spaces are not
            permitted), in case the dist isn't validating its metadata syntax
            itself

0.004     2013-07-30 00:29:20Z
          - now setting dynamic_config => 1 in metadata, as directed in

          - name, description, and always_recommend options are now prefaced
            with dashes, just like -phase and -relationship (to avoid naming
            conflicts)

0.001     2013-07-17 04:24:19Z
